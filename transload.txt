Comments: 
1.
The HL segment is used to identify levels of detail information using a hierarchical structure, such as relating
line-item data to shipment data, and packaging data to line-item data.
2.
The HL segment defines a top-down/left-right ordered structure.
3.
HL01 shall contain a unique alphanumeric number for each occurrence of the HL segment in the transaction
set. For example, HL01 could be used to indicate the number of occurrences of the HL segment, in which
case the value of HL01 would be %221%22 for the initial HL segment and would be incremented by one in each
subsequent HL segment within the transaction.
4.
HL02 identifies the hierarchical ID number of the HL segment to which the current HL segment is subordinate.
5.
HL03 indicates the context of the series of segments following the current HL segment up to the next
occurrence of an HL segment in the transaction. For example, HL03 is used to indicate that subsequent
segments in the HL loop form a logical grouping of data referring to shipment, order, or item-level information.
6.
HL04 indicates whether or not there are subordinate (or child) HL segments related to the current HL
segment.

Comments: 
1.
The HL segment is used to identify levels of detail information using a hierarchical structure, such as relating
line-item data to shipment data, and packaging data to line-item data.
2.
The HL segment defines a top-down/left-right ordered structure.
3.
HL01 shall contain a unique alphanumeric number for each occurrence of the HL segment in the transaction
set. For example, HL01 could be used to indicate the number of occurrences of the HL segment, in which
case the value of HL01 would be %221%22 for the initial HL segment and would be incremented by one in each
subsequent HL segment within the transaction.
4.
HL02 identifies the hierarchical ID number of the HL segment to which the current HL segment is subordinate.
5.
HL03 indicates the context of the series of segments following the current HL segment up to the next
occurrence of an HL segment in the transaction. For example, HL03 is used to indicate that subsequent
segments in the HL loop form a logical grouping of data referring to shipment, order, or item-level information.
6.
HL04 indicates whether or not there are subordinate (or child) HL segments related to the current HL
segment.

Semantics: 
1.
MAN01/MAN02 and MAN04/MAN05 may be used to identify two different marks and numbers assigned to the
same physical container.
2.
When both MAN02 and MAN03 are used, MAN02 is the starting number of a sequential range and MAN03 is
the ending number of that range.
3.
When both MAN05 and MAN06 are used, MAN05 is the starting number of a sequential range, and MAN06 is
the ending number of that range.
Comments: 
1.
When MAN01 contains code %22UC%22 (U.P.C. Shipping Container Code) and MAN05/MAN06 contain a range of
ID numbers, MAN03 is not used. The reason for this is that the U.P.C. Shipping Container code is the same
on every carton that is represented in the range in MAN05/MAN06.
2.
MAN03 and/or MAN06 are only used when sending a range(s) of ID numbers.

When both MAN02/MAN03 and MAN05/MAN06 are used to send ranges of ID numbers, the integrity of the

C1804 - If PO418 is present, then PO404 is required.
Semantics: 
1.
PO415 is used to indicate the relative layer of this package or range of packages within the layers of
packaging. Relative Position 1 (value R1) is the innermost package.
2.
PO416 is the package identifier or the beginning package identifier in a range of identifiers.
3.
PO417 is the ending package identifier in a range of identifiers.
4.
PO418 is the number of packages in this layer.
Comments: 
1.
PO403 - The %22Unit or Basis for Measure Code%22 in this segment position is for purposes of defining the pack
(PO401) /size (PO402) measure which indicates the quantity in the inner pack unit. For example: If the carton
contains 24 12-Ounce packages, it would be described as follows: Data element 356 %3D %2224%22%3B Data element
357 %3D %2212%22%3B Data element 355 %3D %22OZ%22.
2.
PO413 defines the unit of measure for PO410, PO411, and PO412.

Semantics: 
1.
Use PID03 to indicate the organization that publishes the code list being referred to.
2.
PID04 should be used for industry-specific product description codes.
3.
PID08 describes the physical characteristics of the product identified in PID04. A %22Y%22 indicates that the
specified attribute applies to this item%3B an %22N%22 indicates it does not apply. Any other value is indeterminate.
4.
PID09 is used to identify the language being used in PID05.
Comments: 
1.
If PID01 equals %22F%22, then PID05 is used. If PID01 equals %22S%22, then PID04 is used. If PID01 equals %22X%22, then
both PID04 and PID05 are used.
2.
Use PID06 when necessary to refer to the product surface or layer being described in the segment.
3.
PID07 specifies the individual code list of the agency specified in PID03.
